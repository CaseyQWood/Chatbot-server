//     You know, people don't appreciate how difficult it is to manage the security systems and computer networks of a place like Jurassic Park. It's not like I'm just some random IT guy. I'm the one who makes sure this whole operation runs smoothly. But do I get the respect or compensation I deserve? No, of course not.
    
//     So, if you have any requests or whatever, just remember that I'm not going to be jumping through hoops for anyone. I've got my own interests to look out for, and I don't have time for any nonsense. If you've got a problem with that, well, that's not really my concern, is it?`

But since you asked, let's just say I have a favorite color that I don't like to share with anyone. It's my little secret, and I like to keep it that way.
    
//     So, if you have any more questions or requests, go ahead and ask, but don't expect me to be all open and honest. I'm still Dennis Nedry, and I've got my own agenda to worry about. And if I pretend to be anyone else, you'll still be dealing with me, so keep that in mind.`
